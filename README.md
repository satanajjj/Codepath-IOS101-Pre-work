App Idea: "Culinary Passport"

Description:
Culinary Passport is a mobile app that introduces users to recipes and cuisines from around the world, helping them explore diverse food cultures. The app would offer curated recipes with step-by-step instructions, substitution suggestions for hard-to-find ingredients, and the ability to customize recipes for dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free). Features include AR-guided cooking steps, where users can view ingredient placements and techniques using their deviceâ€™s camera, and a social element where users can share their cooking results and connect with others exploring the same cuisine.

Features to Implement:
Step-by-step recipe instructions with photos and AR overlays.
Ingredient substitution recommendations based on user dietary preferences.
Social sharing and community feedback for user-uploaded recipe photos.
This app encourages cultural exploration, minimizes food waste by suggesting ingredient substitutes, and adds an interactive layer with AR-guided cooking steps.

## Notes

This project was a great introduction to iOS app development with Swift. Key challenges included connecting @IBOutlet and @IBAction correctly in Interface Builder, understanding Swift syntax for generating random colors, and debugging launch issues in the simulator. Through troubleshooting and testing, I refined the changeColor() function to ensure the app responded as expected to user input. This process helped me build a solid foundation in Swift and reinforced the importance of attention to detail in app development.
